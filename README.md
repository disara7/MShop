## üîπ Monolithic UI Architecture Explained

This application follows a **monolithic architecture**, which means:

- The **frontend (React)** and **backend (Node/Express)** are closely integrated and deployed together.
- The API, business logic, UI, and data storage all reside in a **single codebase**.
- There are no separate microservice components ‚Äî everything runs as **one unified application**.
